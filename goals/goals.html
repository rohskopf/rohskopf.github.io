                        The problems that Iâ€™m interested in broadly involve atomic-level descriptions of macroscopic
                        phenomena. This spans a wide range, from molecular biology to materials to engineering
                        processes (powerplants, chemical processes, etc.). Such a bottom-up understanding is
                        crucial for engineering next-generation technogolies with more insight than before, by engineering nanoscale    systems to achieve 
                        a desired macroscopic effect.
                    						
                        <h2>Modeling Interatomic and Intermolecular Interactions.</h2>
                        This involves method development to more easily model interactions in any molecule/material. Such models
                        are rooted in quantum mechanics, and often take the form of machine learning and/or complex optimization 
                        problems.

                        <ul type="square">
                        <li>
                        This thrust is central to most others, as properly modeling interactions between atoms is paramount to 
modeling processes in terms of these interactions.
                        </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul type="square">
                        <li>
                        Investigating general procedures/methods to machine learn interatomic potentials that accurately predict thermal and mechanical properties of solids and liquids, especially those used in energy engineering (semiconductors, refrigerants, etc.).
                        </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul type="square">
                        <li>
                        How can we probe and measure these interactions experimentally?
                        </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Computational Materials/Chemical Discovery.</h2>
                        With the advent of fast supercomputers and GPUs, machine learning approaches to discovery have become more tractable.

                        <ul type="square">
                        <li>
                        Molecular dynamics models of disordered solids and interfaces to optimize thermal transport and mechanical properties.
                        </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul type="square">
                        <li>
                        Kinetic theory models of low density fluids to optimize transport properties.
                        </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Molecular Biophysics and Proteins.</h2>
                        I'm particularly interested in the physics of cell metabolism; this is a phenomenal nanoscale energy conversion process which we could learn a lot from in engineering our own nanoscale systems, and in the study of disease pathways that may originate in these processes (e.g., the electron transport chain). Goals here include:
                        <ul type="square">
                        <li>
                        Deeper insights into how biological molecules/proteins interact (especially those
                        involved in cancer/disease pathways), and how to influence these interactions chemically.
                        </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul type="square">
                        <li>
                        Understand the fundamental physics of interactions between biomolecules and proteins. This involves crafting interatomic potentials via quantum mechanics and machine learning, which I have spent a lot of time on for solid materials.
                        </li>
                        </ul>


                        <h2>Multiscale Modelling.</h2>
                        Designing accurate models that traverse vast length and time scales will provide more insight into 
                        various processes of technological interest (e.g. materials processing, shockwaves, explosions, etc.)
                        <ul type="square">
                        <li>

energy/resources.

                        </ul>

                        <h2>Energy Conversion, Storage and Generation.</h2>
