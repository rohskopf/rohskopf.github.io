                        The problems that Iâ€™m interested in broadly involve atomic-level descriptions of macroscopic
                        phenomena. This spans a wide range, from molecular biology to materials to engineering
                        processes (powerplants, chemical processes, etc.). I believe that such a bottom-up understanding is
                        crucial for engineering next-generation technogolies, by engineering nanoscale systems to achieve 
                        a desired macroscopic effect. To this end, my research thrusts are listed below.
                    						
                        <h2>Modeling interatomic and intermolecular interactions.</h2>
                        This involves method development to more easily model interactions in any molecule/material. Such models
                        are rooted in quantum mechanics, and often take the form of machine learning and/or complex optimization 
                        problems.

                        <ul type="square">
                        <li>
                        This thrust is central to most others, as properly modeling interactions between atoms is paramount to 
modeling processes in terms of these interactions.
                        </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul type="square">
                        <li>
                        How can we probe and measure these interactions experimentally?
                        </li>
                        </ul>


                        <h2>Molecular biophysics and protein folding</h2>
                        I'm particular interested in the physics of cell metabolism; this is a phenomenal nanoscale energy conversion process which I think we could learn a lot from in engineering our own nanoscale systems, and in the study of disease pathways that may originate in these processes (e.g., the electron transport chain). Goals here include:
                        <ul type="square">
                        <li>
                        Deeper insights into how biological molecules/proteins interact (especially those
                        involved in cancer/disease pathways), and how to influence these interactions chemically, especially in
                        terms of vibrational modes.
                        </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul type="square">
                        <li>
                        Understand the fundamental physics of interactions between biomolecules and proteins. This involves crafting interatomic potentials via quantum mechanics and machine learning, which I have spent a lot of time on for solid materials.
                        </li>
                        </ul>


                        <h2>Multiscale Modelling</h2>
                        Designing accurate models that traverse vast length and time scales will provide more insight into 
                        various processes of technological interest (e.g. materials processing, shockwaves, explosions, etc.)
                        <ul type="square">
                        <li>
                        Develop methods to model energy transport from nano to micro scales.
                        </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Sustainable Buildings</h2>
                        Humans have always and will continue to live in shelters, the question is how can we optimize the 
efficiency of our shelters? Most energy is used for our comfort, in the form of cooling or heating. 
                        <ul type="square">
                        <li>
                        Develop regional or environmental specific optimizations to building efficiency to save
energy/resources.
                        </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Energy Conversion, Storage and Generation</h2>
                        <ul type="square">
                        <li>
                        Investigate novel methods of energy storage/generation.
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul type="square">
                        <li>
                        How exactly do different forms of energy convert between each other?
                        </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Manufacturing and Materials Processing</h2>
                        Enormous amounts of energy are used daily to manufacture goods and process materials. How can 
                        we better optimize such processes?

                        <h2>Knowledge and Understanding</h2>

                        A solid physical science foundation is required to pursue these goals. I'm therefore constantly
                        honing my skills in the following basic areas:
                        <p></p>
            
					<li>
						Classical Mechanics. The basis of all physics.
					</li>
					<li>
						Fluid Mechanics. The universe is made of quantities that flow.
					</li>
					<li>
						Thermodynamics. Laws of energy and entropy govern all processes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Electromagnetism. The most common of the four fundamental forces that we experience every day, especially regarding interatomic interactions.
					</li>
					<li>
						Quantum Mechanics. To understand how things work at a deep level, we need to know how small particles behave.
					</li>
					<li>
						Heat Transfer. The 2nd law of thermodynamics says that all processes dissipate heat, so we should understand how this heat flows and what to do with it.
					</li>
					<li>
						Statistical Mechanics. We can understand bulk phenomena in terms of its many constituents by applying statistics.
					</li>
					<li>
						Condensed Matter Physics. A deep appreciation for how matter behaves.
					</li>
					<li>
						Experimental Methods. Develop intuition into how the laws of physics are applied to scientific experiments (e.g. microscopy, spectroscopy, etc.).
					</li>
					<li>
						Devices and Processes. How physical principles are applied in engineering applications to achieve desirable effects (e.g. powerplants, solar cells, transistors, etc.).
					</li>
