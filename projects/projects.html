						Projects
					</h1>
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						This page outlines a list of projects, some funded and unfunded, which I am either working on actively or have completed.
					</P>
					
					<h2 class="long" font="Garamond">
						Powerplant Optimization.
					</h2>
					
					<figure> 
						<img src="powerplant.png" class="illustration" align="center" width=300 height=450> 
						<figcaption align="left"> A diagram of a novel powerplant I helped design and optimize, with blue arrows representing work input and output. </figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Powerplants contain many areas where useful energy, usually in the form of heat, is lost to the environment. There are therefore many engineering parameters which may be changed to avoid such losses, although it is a challenging task to optimize efficiency while remaining within viable engineering constraints.
					</P>
					
					<h2 class="long" font="Garamond">
						Phonon Dynamics.
					</h2>
					
					<figure> 
						<img src="mode_decomposition.gif" class="illustration" align="center" width=1200 height=300> 
						<figcaption align="left"> The random vibration of atoms (black circles) is decomposed into different fundamental vibrations called "phonons". </figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Atomic vibrations, also known as phonons, are responsible for various phenomena such as heat transfer, phase changes, and chemical reactions. Other particles, 
						such as photons or electrons, can also interact with vibrations, resulting in various forms of energy transfer and conversion (e.g., electricity to heat). Vibrations can also interact with each other, resulting energy dissipation. It is unknown how vibrations interact, and how these interactions influence chemical and material behavior.
					</P>


					<h2 class="long" font="Garamond">
						Interfacial Heat Transfer.
					</h2>
					
					<figure> 
						<img src="extended_mode.gif" class="illustration" align="center" width=1500 height=200> 
						<figcaption align="center"> A vibrational mode involving atoms of a silicon (red) and germanium (blue) interface.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Intefaces are present in many solid-state devices, where they present a resistance to heat conduction. Optimizing the thermal resistance of such interfaces is therefore crucial to improving the performance of many devices. I investigate how particular vibrational modes influence interfacial heat transfer in solid-solid interfaces, and how these modes can be influenced chemically or externally (e.g., via electric fields) to influence heat transfer.
					</P>


					<h2 class="long" font="Garamond">
						Mass Diffusion.
					</h2>
					
					<figure> 
						<img src="2d_diffusion.gif" class="illustration" align="center" width=300 height=400> 
						<figcaption align="left"> A hydrogen atom (blue) diffusing through a palladium lattice (red). This situation arises in hydrogen energy storage.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Mass diffusion is a crucial phenomenon in materials processing and energy storage/conversion. A molecular-level understanding of how atoms diffuse through materials is therefore crucial to engineer desirable diffusion. I'm particularly interested in how vibrational modes in a solid material influence the hopping of ions between lattice sites, and if these modes can be probed or excited experimentally.

					<h2 class="long" font="Garamond">
						Heat Exchanger Techno-economic Analyses.
					</h2>
					
					<figure> 
						<img src="tooling_investment.png" class="illustration" align="center" width=600 height=300> 
						<figcaption align="center"> Tooling cost of a manufactured product as a function of the annual production volume.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Heat exchangers are a vital part of powerplants which give society the energy it needs, at a viable cost. Design of more efficient heat exchangers is therefore
						paramount to reducing energy costs and more effective utilization of energy resources. A major component of heat exchanger design, and any energy system design 
						for that matter, is the economic component. A techno-economic analysis reveals whether or not a proposed technology is worth making, and includes details such as
						manufacturing (tooling, fabrication, energy usage, etc.), transportation, and material costs. All of these variables combine into a techno-economic model to determine
						the financial viability of a new product.
					</P>
					
					<h2 class="long" font="Garamond">
						High Thermal Conductivity Nonmetallic Composites.
					</h2>
					
					<figure> 
						<img src="high_tc_composite_comparison.png" class="illustration" align="center" width=700 height=300> 
						<figcaption align="center"> An infrared heat transfer comparison of a typical plastic electronic device case (on the left) and our composite (on the right). You can see how 
						our composite distributes more heat from the hot spot.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Modern electronic devices, such as cell phones, tablets, and laptops are decreasing in size and increasing in power due to consumer interest and technological requirements. 
						With this decrease in size and increase in power comes higher heat fluxes, higher energy densities, and ultimately higher device temperatures. The implications of this range
						from uncomfortableness to catching fire. 
					</P>
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						It is therefore of interest to create materials with high thermal conductivity that can dissipate heat in these devices. However, you can't just enclose most devices in metallic casing 
						to dissipate the heat because this would interfere with electromagnetic signaling (i.e., a Faraday cage). We therefore seek nonmetallic high thermal conductivity materials 
						that are cheap and effective at dissipating heat.

						Phonon Optimized Potentials (Pops) Program.
					</h2>
					<figure>

						<figcaption align="center"> A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, showing the motion of atoms in a silicon crystal.</figcaption>

					</figure>
		
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Atoms are always jiggling around, due to their interaction with each other and external forces. These vibrations 
						influence material properties, heat transfer, phase changes, and biological phenomena. If we 
						could simulate atomic vibrations accurately, we could observe their contributions to various phenomena, thus gaining scientific 
						understanding and engineerring insight on how to influence vibrations to yield desireable outcomes. However, traditional models 
						of interactions between atoms yield inaccurate vibrational behavior, and therefore inaccurate predictions.
					</P>
					
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						I use machine learning and artificial intelligence to create and optimize analytical functions that predict accurate
						quantum mechanical forces, and therefore accurate atomic dynamics and vibrations. I've verified the accuracy of my models by
						using them to calculate accurate vibrational and thermal properties of solids. This is all packaged into my open-source Pops program,
						which couples to the LAMMPS software made by Sandia National Labs.

						Large-scale Modular Optimizer Program
					</h2>
					<figure> 
						<img src="rastrigin.gif" class="illustration" align="center" width=400 height=400> 
						<figcaption align="center"> Minimizing the 3D Rastrigin function via differential evolution in my program.</figcaption>
					</figure>
		
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Sure, there are many optimization programs out there, but they're all specified to a particular task. Furthermore, they're slow and not scalable to large clusters of computer nodes. That's where this program comes in. The main goal is to provide a massively parallel program for general optimization programs in a modular framework. In other words, the modularity of the code allows users to upload their own objective function, training data, settings, and optimizer. Of course, for this to be successful, a thorough documentation of the framework is required. Nonetheless, this is the only program of its kind.

						Easy Modular Molecular Mechanics (EM3) Program.
					</h2>
					
					<figure> 
						<img src="argon.png" class="illustration" align="center" width=600 height=200> 
						<figcaption align="center"> Visualization of an argon crystal melting at 158 K using my EM3 program, at different nanosecond (ns) time periods. 
						I verified the accuracy of the dynamics by calculating the diffusion coefficient of liquid argon.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						A plethora of powerful open-source atomistic simulation programs are available to
						the public, including LAMMPS, GROMACS, and many others. With the current
						availability of powerful atomistic simulation programs, the development of another might
						seem futile. EM3, however, possesses a goal that separates it from the rest of the currently
						available programs. Unlike existing programs possessing goals centered around simulation
						performance, the goal of EM3 is more educational and simplistic. The educational goal
						centers around the simple (easy) objective-oriented (modular) C++ source code of EM3,
						which aside from being powerful and efficient, seeks to bridge the gap between less
						powerful but easily understood MATLAB and Python codes scattered about the internet
						and more powerful but complicated larger programs like LAMMPS and GROMACS (also
						written in C++ and C, respectively). This educational goal is readily realized by considering
						the seemingly lack of intensive developer guides for existing programs; this issue may
						hinder a new researcher, such as a student beginning work in atomistic simulations, from
						transcending the role of a simple user to a developer, thus gaining the ability to perform
						more meaningful work. A commonality across the commonly used MD programs is that
						they are object-oriented; this is a necessary component when developing extendable opensource programs that can readily be modified by any user. Newcomers to the field may
						find that there is much to learn in terms of object-oriented programming and its relation to
						organizing a proper MD code. This is where EM3 comes in; it provides a framework for 
						modularly organized atomistic simulation codes, and its open-source availability allows
						beginners to familiarize themselves with the type of application of object-oriented C++ that
						is seen in larger and more powerful programs such as LAMMPS. EM3 strives to be a
						“light” (easy) version of the larger MD programs like LAMMPS and GROMACS, without
						sacrificing computational power since it is written in the powerful C++ language and
						supports parallel compilation with MPI. While parallelized MD is not yet implemented,
						the EM3 source code includes MPI headers and initializers and is compiled using MPI, so
						that future work can result in parallelization.

					<h2 class="long" font="Garamond">
						Modular Artificial Neural Network Trainer (Modulant) Program.
					</h2>
					
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						There are many powerful open-source neural network trainers out there (e.g. Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc.), but how many of them
						are massively parallel and built to run on clusters of many CPUs? Not many. This is where Modulant comes in, and incorporates 
						parallel semi-batch neural network training.
					</P>
					
					<h2 class="long" font="Garamond">
						Physics Tutorials.
					</h2>
					
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						You can find many physical science tutorials across the web (Khan Academy, etc.) but none of them are quite at the caliber of advanced
						undergrad level. I've studied a lot of physics, might as well disseminate it to the world. These tutorials include 5-minute videos on topics
						and interesting problems in the following fields:
					</P>
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Classical Mechanics. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics - the basis of all modern physics.
					</P>
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Fluid Mechanics. The universe is made of quantities that flow.
					</P>
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Thermodynamics. Laws of energy and entropy govern all processes.
					</P>
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Electromagnetism. The most common of the four fundamental forces that we experience every day.
					</P>
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Quantum Mechanics. To understand how things work at a deep level, we need to know how small particles behave.
					</P>
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Heat Transfer. The 2nd law of thermodynamics says that all processes dissipate heat, so we should understand how this heat flows and what to do with it.
					</P>
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Statistical Mechanics. We can understand bulk phenomena in terms of its many constituents by applying statistics.
					</P>
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Condensed Matter Physics. A deep appreciation for how matter behaves.
					</P>
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Experimental Methods. Develop intuition into how the laws of physics are applied to scientific experiments (e.g. microscopy, spectroscopy, etc.).
					</P>
					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
						Devices and Processes. How physical principles are applied in engineering applications to achieve desirable effects (e.g. powerplants, solar cells, transistors, etc.).
					</P>
						Any modern scientist or engineer should be adept in these fields at the level of an advanced undergrad, or as they say at MIT for the Mechanical Engineering qualifying exams, "a graduate level understanding of undergraduate topics". 
						Once adept, we should stay fresh on these topics with daily review and problem solving, so that we can sleep on it (your brain synthesizes information and makes connections in your sleep)
						and apply it to our daily research.
					</P>
